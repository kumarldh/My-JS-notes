My JavaScript notes. JS fascinates me and confuses me. Following JS code is from WTF JS[1]


var foo = [0];
console.log(foo == !foo); //returns true
console.log(foo == foo); //returns true

All notes depend on node.js untill & unless a window object is used, in which case, I either used chrome or firefox.
